        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a junior at Brigham Young University. I am majoring in
	  Bioinformatics. I love the biological sciences and I really wanted to
	  become proficient in computers so this was the perfect major! I am
	  planning on going to medical school after I finish college. I do not
	  know what kind of doctor I want to be yet. Hopefully I can get that 
	  figured out soon.
	</p>
        <p>
          Some of my passions outside of school are choir, fantasy, and rock
	  climbing. I love singing with the BYU Concert Choir especially during
	  Christmas time because it just lightens my day every day and takes
	  some of the burden of school off my shoulders. I love reading fantasy 
	  books, watching fantasy shows, and making fantasy worlds. The impulse 
	  to create something drives my desire to make worlds and stories that 
	  have never existed before. Finally, rock climbing is a fun way that I 
	  can keep my body healthy.
	</p>
        <p>
          Of course, the most important thing to me is my friends and family. 
	  Spending time with them is the most enjoyable thing I do. Anyways, 
	  that's me :)

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          So, the tentative idea for my project is just a fun little user created
	  garden. I have to admit the idea wasn't entirely original, but I'll do 
	  my best to make it unique. Users will be able to logon and create a 
	  garden that other users will be able to see. The gardens can be saved 
	  so that you can come back to them any time you want! You can also have 
	  friends in the game. Welcome to Plantarium! insert link here.

        <h2>Simon project</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I only have the html implementation of my simon website running
          Simon is the game where you press the buttons that light up in the order they
          lit up. The game gets harder as you go.
